## Interview  

When diving through the tech interviews a lot of times we are faced with questions for which there is a lot we want to say , but due to some reason , we are not able to present our thought process. 

the strategy is to learn how to tell a great story focusing on the basics of the questions rather than trying to explain the possiblity. 

One major problem I have seen which interviewee do is that they try to explain what the particular technology can do rather than what they did with that technology. 


For preparing for an interview a few things are must and we suggest to keep that in mind while preparing

- Be familiar with SDL Softwware Development LifeCycle
- Be familiar with most common flows 
- Be familiar with most common tools
- Be familiar with most common clouds
- Be familiar with most common mistakes



Apart from that 

- Learn from case studies 
- Learn from case studies from different tech blogs
- Pratice a lot on different platforms
