## Understanding the basic need of system design interview

System design is a crucial aspect of software development that involves designing the architecture and components of a system to meet specific requirements. It encompasses various elements such as scalability, reliability, performance, and security. By carefully considering these factors, system designers can create robust and efficient solutions that can handle large amounts of data and user traffic.

In this section, we will explore the fundamentals of system design and delve into different strategies and techniques used to design scalable and reliable systems.

We will look at some popular design questions , some more specific design questions and how someone should prepare themseleves for handling those problems. 

Again , individual choice of design is dependent upon various factors and no best design can be declared mere based on few points. Only after a longer run , with enough analytical data in hand a design can be evaluated for it's particular aspect. 

When you are stepping a foot in an interview for design , it's rather important you relaise you are there for find a solution that is needed rather than telling a solution that you know. 

Only way to achieve this is to understand the problem space, ask clarifying questions instead of making assumptions , define key constraints and boundaries , ponder on different options , think about key aspects of design , suggest a solution that works, refine or improve. 


We will talk about different strategies which can help you to organize your interview process in a better flow.
