It is also highly adaptable and can be used for small applications and as well as large, complex ones. Event-driven architecture is made up of decoupled event processing components that asynchronously receive and process events. It can be used as a standalone architecture style or embedded within other architecture styles.\nThere are two primary topologies within event-driven architecture: the mediator topology and the broker topology\nThe broker topology differs from the mediator topology in that there is no central event mediator. Rather, the message flow is distributed across the event processor components in a chain-like broadcasting fashion through a lightweight message broker (such as RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, HornetQ, and so on). This topology is useful when you have a relatively simple event processing flow and you do not need central event orchestration and coordination.\nThe main issue with asynchronous communications is error handling. While responsiveness is significantly improved, it is difficult to address error conditions, adding to the complexity of the event-driven system.
