## SDL - Software Development lifecycle

software development lifecycle of your product is an essential or say most essential aspect that everyone should be knowing. 
It reflects as to what level you go to understand your product. 
Many times people only focus on what they work on and can miss the part of the flow 


here are a few thoughts to keep in mind when questions related to sdl are asked

- We hae think about the product so we need some documents, designs 
- We have to write a code so we need some IDE, language , platform and collaborative code repo
- We have to build the code and for that will need a build infra structure 
- we have to deploy the code and for that will need a deployment pipeline or infra
- we have to run services on some infra so need that infra or system so think about cloud
- we have to monitor the services so need monitoring and logging 
- we can't build everything ourselves so will need some third party depdencies


now in each of these lines think about 5 pieces
- security  - you need to secure everything that you do in above steps
- maintainbility 
- scale
- reliability
