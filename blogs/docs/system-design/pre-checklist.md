### Basic Stationery Box 

Design interviews mostly talk about choice the right solution for the problem in hand, but most of solutions are picked up from a box of several choices. 
In-order for someone to choose from a box, somene must put something in the box , and this is where the box of tools comes into picture. 

Mostly in interviews a few things are common amongst which you need to make a choice. 


- Services
- Databases
- Networks 
- Caches 
- Languages 
- Protocols
- Security Options
- Operating Systems 
- Memory Managements 
- Data Structures
- Messaging 
- Algorithms 
- integration patterns

etc. 

These can be considered as subsection in your tool-box and you will see you have a pool of choices within each sub-section and you need to make a choice , and in order to do that you need to understand the basic requirement of the problem and then basic capability of that tool , for example to make a hole in a wall you will not take out a pin-hole bit.


### CAP 
Always Remember Cap theorem: Choose between availability and scalability




Most of the questions will be targeted towards understanding the data ingestion pipelines, and that involve focusing on below issues 

- How various requests to service will be coming ( single/buffered/batch)
- How will timeouts be considered depending on type of requests
- What will API look like 
- How does client â€“ implement a re-try mechanism
- Where data is getting stored temporary
- How do you deal with duplicates 
- How do you scale a single service
- How the increase in database though through
- Which type of database is required. 
- How the incoming requests will be processed and stored. 
- Fault handling and tolerance of the system 
- Error Handling 
- What happens when something goes wrong , bottle necks etc.


Concepts while implementing a client 

1) Blocking vs Non-blocking calls (threads/ asyncs )
2) Buffering/ batching ? ( example logger client) 
3) timeouts (request timeouts 1% of slowest requests times)
4) retries  ( retry storm events , overload server with too many request )
5) exponential backoff and jitter algorithms
6) circuit breaker
